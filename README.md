Integrating basscss into a wordpress theme

## Requires Twenty-Fifteen
This is an early stage project. To begin with I´ve just linked the base.min.css of basscss into a Wordpress child theme from the default theme Twenty fifteen. With time I´ll diverge more from the given theme into something more customized.

This is just a learning project. I'm happy if you find this helpful but it is far from being usable by someone other than myself. Sorry for the inconvenience.
